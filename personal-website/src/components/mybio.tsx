        <p className="mx-10 mt-5 mb-1"> I&apos;m a sophomore at UNC double majoring in Computer Science and Data Science. 
            In the future I would like to research how developments in artificial intelligence will 
            impact society, and develop human centered AI tools. I grew up in Greensboro, North Carolina
            where I attended the Early College at Guilford. At Guilford I took my first programming classes
            and was drawn to the fields intersection between creativity, mathematics, and problem solving.
            The culture of innovation and progress is something I want to continue as I learn more, build projects,
            and apply to internships and graduate programs.

        <p className="mx-10 mt-5 mb-1">Outside of the classroom I spend my time running, reading, and listening to music. I ran my first
            marathon in November 2024 in Richmond Virginia and I&apos;m currently training for my next one. I just finished 
            reading Recursion by Blake Crouch and may read the Lord of the Rings next. As for music I am always
            finding something new, but folk, indie rock, and hip-hop will always be favorites.
